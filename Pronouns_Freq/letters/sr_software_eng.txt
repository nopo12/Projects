Sr. Software Engineer Position
Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you in reference to the job posting you have made for the Sr. Software Engineer position at your company. I believe I would be an excellent fit for this position since I am a software engineer with a wide variety of experience in the field.

I tend to view myself as a generalist since I try not to focus on any given technology. My skills range from Ruby On Rails, Assembly, to Java, Swift, Objective-C and JavaScript. I have been exposed to a wide variety of technologies in my career and consider myself to be very adaptable.

Because of my breadth of experience I believe that I would make an excellent addition to your team.

Sincerely,
Kelly George
