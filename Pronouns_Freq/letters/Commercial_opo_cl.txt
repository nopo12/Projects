Commercial Operations Specialist
Dear Sir/Madam,

It is with great enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position of Commercial Operations Specialist with Nespresso Denmark. I am a Commercial Operations professional with over 5 years’ experience, I know my diverse skill set and qualifications will make me an asset to the Nespresso Organisation.

As you will see from the attached CV, I’ve built my career in a variety of roles and industries, mostly in international companies such as PANDORA, IKEA, JABRA & VELUX, where I'm used to wearing many hats, and I sincerely enjoy it; I thrive in an environment where no two work days are exactly the same.

In addition to having a commercial and analytical mindset, I have strong IT solutions knowhow, and am a super user in Excel, Powerpoint, various BI/sales sytems (Qlikview, Cognos) as well as ERP systems like Navision & AX Dynamics. I like nothing better than diving into data to uncover results, or finding solutions to difficult challenges to improve the business. 

On a personal level, I am Australian born, soon to be Danish citizen. I lived in the Australia the first 20 years of my life, before moving to UK to work for a Danish Company, then moved to Denmark 17 years ago when I settled down to married my husband, Together we have two children (11 & 14 years old). I am a native English speaker, fluent in Danish.

In closing, I am thrilled at the possibility of being Operations Specialist with Nespresso a company to which which I see is not only an innovative & ambious company, but one with a social conscience. I would love the opportunity to meet with you and discuss the value that I can bring to Nespresso and I appreciate your consideration and look foward to hearing from you.

Warmest regards,


Mary Parker
