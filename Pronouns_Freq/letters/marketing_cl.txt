Dear Sir or Madam,

I should be grateful if you would consider my application for the position required.
Please be informed that I recently got married and moved to Muscat, Oman this March 2016. Hence, I am looking forward to search for a new career opportunity in a well-established organization in Muscat, where my academic background and personnel skills will allow me the opportunity of growth.

I enjoy twelve years of solid experience in fields of hospitality and hotel management including experience in the Marketing, eCommerce, Public Relations, Sales and Executive Management. I was able to generate success in every project completed and delivered within business.

During my last position, as Marketing Manager for Hilton Alexandria Green Plaza I was responsible for proposing and implementing marketing strategies that promote revenue growth generation among key targeted segments and support the hotel’s brand positioning and image. My responsibilities also included leveraging and executing social media and website strategies to achieve brand position and revenue growth goals.

For two years in a row I was able to achieve awards for “Best Tactical Marketing Campaign” in 2014 and “Best Social Media Engagement” in 2013 among Hilton Hotels & Resorts Middle East and Africa at the Hilton Worldwide Awards.

I am very keen to take new responsibilities with bigger operations and high challenges. I am a fast learner and can adapt to new situations, moving from Executive Secretary to Sales Account Manager to Marketing Manager in charge of Public Relations with success made in each position.

I am also trilingual with fluent verbal and written skills in Arabic, English and German languages and experienced in dealing with different cultures and nationalities.

I hope I may be granted a personal interview, if you feel my qualifications fit me for the position needed.

Looking forward to working with your esteemed organization.



Yours sincerely,
Aisha Hakim
